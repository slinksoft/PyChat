# PyChat
A proof of concept multithreaded TCP chat written in Python.

I wanted to work on another Python project, so I decied to look up examples of TCP servers/clients and this is what I came up with.

On my repository, I also have a multi-threaded chatroom written in Java. With how useful Python is with network programming, I wanted to develop a chatroom in the language as well.

Turns out, it's harder to write this sort of program in Python versus Java. My only guess for the reason of that is the way Python deals with sockets.
